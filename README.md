# RAG_learning-
In this repo, I document my learning journey with LangChain to create a chatbot and a RAG system. 

The file "chatbot101" contains the baseics for working with a chatbot. I use the Gemini API because it is free and I found it very similar to the OpenAI API, with only a few differences.

The file "RAG" outlines the steps for creating a RAG system: indexing, retrieval, and generation.

The last file, "RAG project," is an application of what I learned to create a chatbot that provides answers based on the files I provide it.
